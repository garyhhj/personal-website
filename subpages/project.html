        <p class="paragraphDescription"> 
            This is by far the most challenging project I have worked on. I dislike losing in chess so I wrote a chess engine that could 
            play better than me. It finds chess moves that I would never be able to find, especially in a game situation. It has a playing 
            strength of ~1800elo and has beaten 2000 rated chess bots on 
            <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.chess.com/"> chess.com</a>. A demo of this 
            chess engine can be seen in the <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://github.com/garyhhj/chess-engine-v2"> readme</a>.  
        </p>

        <p class="paragraphDescription"> 
            I used C/C++ to write this chess engine. What impressed me while researching this project is the amount of dedication that the
            chess programming community has put into finding optimization techniques. The explainations on 
            <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page"> Chess Programming Wiki</a> as well as posts 
            about world's fastest chess move generator on 
            <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-Fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator"> 
            code project</a> helped me understand many of these optimization techniques for tree prunning and bit manipulation.

        <a class="projectTitleLink" href="https://github.com/garyhhj/chip8"> <strong> Chip8 Emulator </strong> </a>
        <p class="paragraphDescription">
            I always wondered how computers worked so I wrote a <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8"> chip8</a> 
            emulator to  help better my understanding. This project was very enjoyable to write and helped me improve my C++ skills.

        <a class="projectTitleLink" href="https://github.com/garyhhj/sudoku-solver"> <strong>  Sudoku Solver </strong> </a>
        <p class="paragraphDescription">
            I wrote a sudoku solver so I can solve sudoku as fast as the pros. What makes this sudoku solver faster than other sudoku solver 
            using the normal <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking"> backtracking</a> 
            algorithm was that it greedily chooses the 3x3 square with the least number of options to reduce possible tree branching to search.
