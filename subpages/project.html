    <h1> Project </h1>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/garyhhj/chess-engine-v2"> chess engine </a>
    <p> 
        This is by far the most challenging project I have worked on. I dislike losing in chess so I wrote a chess engine that could 
        play better than me. It finds chess moves that I would never be able to find, especially in a game situation. It has a playing 
        strength of ~1800elo and has beaten 2000 rated chess bots on <a href="https://www.chess.com/"> chess.com</a>. A demo of this 
        chess engine can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/garyhhj/chess-engine-v2"> readme</a>.  
    </p>

    <p> 
        I used C/C++ to write this chess engine. What impressed me while researching this project is the amount of dedication that the
        chess programming community has put into finding optimization techniques. The explainations on 
        <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page"> Chess Programming Wiki</a> as well as posts about world's fastest chess 
        move generator on <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-Fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator"> code project</a>
        helped me understand many of these optimization techniques for tree prunning and bit manipulation.

    <!-- insert nes emulator project after done here -->

    <a href="https://github.com/garyhhj/chip8"> chip8 emulator </a>
    <p>
        I always wondered how computers worked so I wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8"> chip8</a> emulator to 
        help better my understanding. This project was very enjoyable to write and helped me improve my C++ skills.

    <a href="https://github.com/garyhhj/sudoku-solver"> sudoku solver </a>
    <p>
        I wrote a sudoku solver so I can solve sudoku as fast as the pros. What makes this sudoku solver faster than other sudoku solver 
        using the normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking"> backtracking</a> algorithm was that it greedily chooses the 3x3 square with the least number of options to reduce 
        possible tree branching to search.
